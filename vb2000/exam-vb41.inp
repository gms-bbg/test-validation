! In this case the $GENCTL and $GRPDIM keywords are not necessary, because
! it generates automatically the GVB-PP group spliting from the "GPF(3)"
! specification below. But we keep them in the file to make clear the
! partition of the groups: core electrons and lone pairs in one group 
! treated at HF level and the 2 groups as the O-H bonds, treated at SCVB
! (with 2 electrons is equivalent to GVB-PP) level. In this case the 
! initial orbitals are generated correctly from a default localization
! process in VB2000, but generally it is necessary to provide a proper 
! set of initial orbitals (see the VB2000 manual for more details). It 
! could be done as well as a GPF(5) calculation, treating the lone pairs 
! also at GVB level.
