! GAMESS/VB2000 Test 29
!
! This is a test of using the GVB non-orthogonal orbitals as
! the initial guess. It is the simplest possible calculation 
! for H2, where the GVB is actually identical to the VB
! calculation. The guess is actually the final result so it 
! converges after only one macroiteration. Note, that perhaps
! surprisingly, for larger cases getting the same result as 
! the GAMESS GVB takes more than one macroiteration.
!
! GVB ENERGY IS -1.1468743320 AFTER   7 ITERATIONS
!
! ENERGY AND DIFF OF MACROITER    3 =     -1.1468743320
