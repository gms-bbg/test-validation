!    N3O4, i.e. dinitramide anion, only without the charge, so it's an

!    A CI-singles is done to test the truth of Brillouin's Thm.

!    ROHF has FINAL E= -462.4145369251 in 17 iterations.

!    default run is GUGA which generates 790 CSFs,
!    S.ATE # 1 ENERGY = -462.414536925 which is the ROHF energy, and
!    a CI coefficient of 1.000000 for CSF #10 which is the ROHF config.

!    switching to ORMAS which generates 2274 determinants, and
!    S.ATE   1  ENERGY= -462.4281827129  S=  0.50  SZ=  0.50  SPACE SYM=B
!    the state has a CI coefficient of 0.9930787 for the ROHF determinant.

!    the run takes 7 seconds on 2.66 GHz Cloverton (18 Jul 2010)
!
!    The reason for ORMAS not getting a unit CI vector reproducing the
!    ROHF energy is the "singles" below includes some double excitations.
!    Namely, some of the ORMAS determinants will promote a beta electron
!    from filled to alpha space, while also exciting the alpha electron
!    from the alpha to virtual space.  This double excitation has three
!    unpaired e-: two alpha and one beta spin, so it obeys both Ms=1/2,
!    and the ORMAS occupancy rules MINE/MAXE, thus is used.
!
!    The GUGA program has an option -INTACT- going back to Charlie Bender
!    and Fritz Schaefer, JCP 55, 4798-4803(1971) that includes the CSFs
!    if and only if they have a non-vanishing Hamiltonian element with
!    the ROHF configuration.  That's the very essence of Brillouin's Thm.
!    If the -INTACT- is turned off, we get 15610 CSFs, and E= -462.470394599
!    because the GUGA program considers "single" to mean one (1) electron
!    excited into the external space, regardless how many electrons are
!    excited from the filled to alpha orbital, so many doubles are added.
