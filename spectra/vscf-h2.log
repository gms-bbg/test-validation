 EXECUTION OF GAMESS BEGUN Tue Nov 29 00:37:45 2016

            ECHO OF THE FIRST FEW INPUT CARDS -
 INPUT CARD>!   H2, using a basis from Mike's thesis, (10s,3p,1d)/[5s,3p,1d].               
 INPUT CARD>!   For 2 electrons, full CI is equivalent to RHF + CI-SD, and                  
 INPUT CARD>!   as GAMESS knows it has gradients for the latter, it will run                
 INPUT CARD>!   the preliminary geometry optimization and numerical hessian.                
 INPUT CARD>!                                                                               
 INPUT CARD>!   The FCI energy of H2 is -1.1730312040, at R=0.7408715                       
 INPUT CARD>!   The ROHF energy of H is -0.4999951120, so the FCI De= 4.71 eV.              
 INPUT CARD>!   The FCI harmonic frequency is 4416.22 wavenumbers

 INPUT CARD>!   This run is set to use 32 points on the 1D PES, to get w= 4176.51           
 INPUT CARD>!
