            ECHO OF THE FIRST FEW INPUT CARDS -
 INPUT CARD>!   TRUDGE optimization of N2 at the CR-CCSD(T) level.                          
 INPUT CARD>!   The basis set used is Dunning's original DZ contraction to [4s,2p]          
 INPUT CARD>!   of Huzinaga-san's (9s,5p) set.  There are no polarization functions.        
 INPUT CARD>!   Two very high energy virtuals are omitted from the CC calculation.          
 INPUT CARD>!

 INPUT CARD>!   The  last   TRUDGE ENERGY VALUE is -109.1087991999, at R=1.1497149          
 INPUT CARD>!   This run takes 37 steps, it seems like far too many for 1 coordinate.
