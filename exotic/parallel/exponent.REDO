 EXECUTION OF GAMESS BEGUN Sat Jul 29 22:48:53 2017

            ECHO OF THE FIRST FEW INPUT CARDS -
 INPUT CARD>!  F atom, 6-311G(d) orbital exponent optimization test.                        
 INPUT CARD>!  Both MCSCF and CI are run in the same job stream, to test                    
 INPUT CARD>!  their coexistence.                                                           
 INPUT CARD>!                                                                               
 INPUT CARD>!  The d exponent is optimized, using a wavefunction that                       
 INPUT CARD>!  preserves both space and spin symmetry for the open shell                    
 INPUT CARD>!  atom.  The optimization is on a variational energy, the                      
 INPUT CARD>!  singles and doubles CI function.  The result is a final                      
 INPUT CARD>!  CI energy of -99.5662491856, with zeta(d)=1.633187.                          
 INPUT CARD>!                                                                               
 INPUT CARD>!  It is interesting to compare this value to the 6-311G(d)                     
 INPUT CARD>!  value obtained by Pople for F, using UHF (spin and space                     
 INPUT CARD>!  symmetry broken) + UMP2 (non-variational), zeta(d)=1.750.                    
 INPUT CARD>!  You can easily convert this job to a UHF + UMP2 trudge,                      
 INPUT CARD>!  and then you will learn Pople didn't use the frozen core                     
 INPUT CARD>!  approximation.  A frozen core UMP2 exponent optimization                     
 INPUT CARD>!  gives a value very close to the CISD value found here.                       
 INPUT CARD>!                                                                               
 INPUT CARD>!  This run takes 37 seconds on a mac G4 (28 May 2005)                          
 INPUT CARD>!

 INPUT CARD>!   input to define the MCSCF orbital optimization.  Note that                  
 INPUT CARD>!   the three 2-P states are averaged to preserve radial degeneracy.            
 INPUT CARD>!   This is really an open shell SCF computation, since there is                
 INPUT CARD>!   the same number of configurations as degenerate roots of the                
 INPUT CARD>!   Hamiltonian.

 INPUT CARD>!   Actually, there is an equivalent SCFTYP=GVB way to obtain the               
 INPUT CARD>!   ground state energy, see REFS.DOC.  It needs NOSYM=1 since                  
 INPUT CARD>!   the canonicalizations mess up orbital symmetry.                             
 INPUT CARD>!
