!   This is an example of analytic computation of non-resonance Raman
!   spectra using DFTB3 and the ARAMAN=.TRUE. option in $DFTB. The
!   algorithm employes Wigner's 2n+1 rule, instead of solving second-order
!   coupled-perturbed equations.
!
!   This input file should give an total energy of -4.0715925760 hartree,
!   and the residual gradient vector should be nearly zero (optimized
!   with OPTTOL=1.0D-09, although such a tight convergence is not usually
!   necessary). In addition, the non-translational and non-rotational
!   vibrational modes should give the following properties.

!   One can also obtain polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities
!   automatically. This calculation does not require much effort, so they
!   are always computed when ARAMAN=.TRUE. Most values are zero, but
!   We should get the following non-zero values for polarzability: 
! POLARIZABILITY      XX  =        5.0665690181
! POLARIZABILITY      YY  =        2.8355878150
!   and for hyperpolarizabilities:
! HYPER-POLARIZABILITY FOR Y-X-X =             -4.9706321678
! HYPER-POLARIZABILITY FOR Y-Y-Y =             -1.3548083169
