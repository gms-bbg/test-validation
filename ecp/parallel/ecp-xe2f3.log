 EXECUTION OF GAMESS BEGUN 15:48:14 15-MAR-2022    

            ECHO OF THE FIRST FEW INPUT CARDS -
 INPUT CARD>!  A bodacious test input on Xe2F3 +1 ion, from Jerry.                          
 INPUT CARD>!  This input turned up the bug in subroutine RECUR in April 2008.              
 INPUT CARD>!                                                                               
 INPUT CARD>!  This is not at an optimized geometry so residuals are not 0,                 
 INPUT CARD>!  but we do have full linear symmetry apparent in the values,                  
 INPUT CARD>!  and translation residuals vanish.
